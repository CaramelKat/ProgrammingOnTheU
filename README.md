# ProgrammingOnTheU
A quick guide to Wii U programming; aimed at old programming hands

This tutorial is currently in the draft phase. It's missing bits, there will be grammar errors, and it's nowhere near a comprehensive guide. Feel free to fork and pull request it as you wish.  

Start [here](/tutorial/Chapter%201.md)!

If you're looking for the old, HBL-compatible version of this tutorial, you can find that [here](https://github.com/QuarkTheAwesome/ProgrammingOnTheU/tree/24536c9deada178794b825484131ded79b790430). Keep in mind that I haven't worked on it or maintained it since January 2017; and that the scene has changed dramatically since I wrote it. I strongly recommend you work with wut for almost all uses.
