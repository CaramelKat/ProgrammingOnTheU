**Chapter 3 - Hello, world!**

Time to get down and dirty with some actual code! I've thrown together a Hello World example for HBL that we're going to take a look at. In this chapter, you'll see how **OSDynLoad** works in practice, the way to use **OSScreen**, reading from the DRC with **VPAD** functions, and it all comes together in a HBL-compatible way.
